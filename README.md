# MoocVisualization
Research project exploring how data visualizations can be used to improve both cognitive engagement for students and iterative content development for educators in massive open online courses. 

## (Proposed) Supporting Infrastucture 
### MOOC Feedback System
We propose a system for allowing students to provide feedback that instructors can use for both immediate action and iterative course improvement. The existence of the proposed system would facilitate the development of visualizations similar to what we explore here, the goals of which are to improve cognitive engagement of students and to provide educators with valuable insights to help them improve their content. 

<b>Core Feature for Students</b>
- If a student experiences confusion when watching a MOOC video, they can pause and click on the area of the screen associated with their confusion.
- i.e., each flag (click) corresponds to one (x,y,time) point in the video 
- In aggregate, these data points can be used to visualize what was generally confusing to students for a given video

<b>Core Feature for Instructors</b>
The system will present student confusion 

## (Implemented) Visualization Components
### Heatmapped Video

### Custom Video Player
